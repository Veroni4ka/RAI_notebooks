{"query": "What is version control?", "context": "Software development teams need ways to track changes to code and collaborate effectively on projects.", "ground_truth": "A system that tracks changes to files over time", "response": "Version control is a system that tracks changes to files (like code, documents, or data) over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, revert to previous versions if needed, and maintain a history of modifications. Popular tools include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial. It's essential for software development to manage codebases efficiently and avoid conflicts."}
{"query": "What does API stand for?", "context": "Modern software applications often need to communicate with other systems and services to exchange data.", "ground_truth": "Application Programming Interface", "response": "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. For example, a web API might let your app fetch data from a server, like weather information from a service."}
{"query": "What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?", "context": "Programming languages can be executed in different ways, affecting performance and portability.", "ground_truth": "Compiled languages are translated to machine code before execution, interpreted languages are executed line by line", "response": "- **Compiled languages** (e.g., C++, Java, Go) are translated from high-level code into machine code (executable binaries) by a compiler before runtime. This process happens once, making execution faster but requiring recompilation for changes.\n- **Interpreted languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby) are executed line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter, without a separate compilation step. They're often easier to debug and more portable but can be slower in performance compared to compiled languages.\n\nThe key difference is in how and when the code is converted to machine-readable instructions: ahead of time (compiled) vs. on-the-fly (interpreted). Some languages, like Java, use a hybrid approach with bytecode compilation and just-in-time (JIT) interpretation."}
{"query": "What is continuous integration?", "context": "DevOps practices help teams automate testing and deployment to deliver software more reliably.", "ground_truth": "Automatically building and testing code changes frequently", "response": "Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository (e.g., multiple times a day). Automated builds and tests are run on each merge to detect issues early. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI are commonly used. It helps catch bugs quickly, improves code quality, and supports collaborative workflows."}
{"query": "What is a REST API?", "context": "Web services use standardized architectural patterns to enable communication between different applications.", "ground_truth": "An API that follows REpresentational State Transfer principles", "response": "A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of web API that follows REST architectural principles. It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. Data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are stateless, scalable, and widely used for web services (e.g., the Twitter API or Stripe payment API). They're designed to be simple and leverage existing web standards."}
{"query": "What is the purpose of unit testing?", "context": "Software quality assurance requires testing at multiple levels to catch bugs early in development.", "ground_truth": "Testing individual components or functions in isolation", "response": "Unit testing is the practice of writing automated tests for individual components or \"units\" of code (e.g., functions or methods) to ensure they work as expected in isolation. The purpose is to catch bugs early, verify functionality, facilitate refactoring, and provide documentation through examples. Frameworks like JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), or Jest (JavaScript) are used. It promotes reliable software by isolating issues before they affect the larger system."}
{"query": "What is agile methodology?", "context": "Software development methodologies provide frameworks for organizing work and delivering value iteratively.", "ground_truth": "An iterative approach to software development emphasizing flexibility and collaboration", "response": "Agile methodology is an iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It breaks work into small, manageable increments (e.g., sprints in Scrum) rather than a rigid plan. Key principles include adaptive planning, continuous improvement, and delivering working software frequently. Frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, or Extreme Programming (XP) fall under agile. It's contrasted with traditional \"waterfall\" methods, which are more linear and sequential."}
{"query": "What is a database index?", "context": "Database performance optimization involves structures that speed up data retrieval operations.", "ground_truth": "A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval", "response": "A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like an index in a book, allowing the database engine to quickly locate rows without scanning the entire table. Indexes are typically created on columns that are frequently searched or joined (e.g., using B-trees or hash tables). However, they add overhead for write operations (inserts/updates) and require storage space. Common in relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL."}
{"query": "What is Docker?", "context": "Containerization technologies help developers package applications with their dependencies for consistent deployment.", "ground_truth": "A platform for developing and running applications in containers", "response": "Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an app with its dependencies (code, runtime, libraries) into a standardized unit that can run consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). It uses containerization technology (based on Linux namespaces and cgroups) to isolate apps without needing full virtual machines. Docker Hub is a registry for sharing container images, and it's often used with tools like Kubernetes for orchestration."}
{"query": "What is the Big O notation used for?", "context": "Algorithm efficiency analysis helps developers understand performance characteristics of their code.", "ground_truth": "Describing the time or space complexity of algorithms", "response": "Big O notation (O(n), O(1), etc.) is a mathematical way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, particularly how its runtime or space requirements grow with input size (n). It's used to analyze efficiency:\n- O(1): Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element).\n- O(n): Linear time (e.g., looping through a list).\n- O(n²): Quadratic time (e.g., nested loops).\nIt focuses on the worst-case scenario and ignores constants, helping developers choose optimal algorithms for scalability in fields like data structures and algorithms."}
