{"query": "What is version control?", "context": "Software development teams need ways to track changes to code and collaborate effectively on projects.", "ground_truth": "A system that tracks changes to files over time", "response": "A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions, collaborate with others, and manage code history. Git is the most popular example."}
{"query": "What does API stand for?", "context": "Modern software applications often need to communicate with other systems and services to exchange data.", "ground_truth": "Application Programming Interface", "response": "**Application Programming Interface** - a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other."}
{"query": "What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?", "context": "Programming languages can be executed in different ways, affecting performance and portability.", "ground_truth": "Compiled languages are translated to machine code before execution, interpreted languages are executed line by line", "response": "- **Compiled**: Code is translated to machine code before execution (C++, Java). Faster runtime, but requires compilation step.\n- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line-by-line at runtime (Python, JavaScript). Slower execution, but more flexible and portable."}
{"query": "What is continuous integration?", "context": "DevOps practices help teams automate testing and deployment to deliver software more reliably.", "ground_truth": "Automatically building and testing code changes frequently", "response": "A development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, with automated builds and tests running to detect issues early."}
{"query": "What is a REST API?", "context": "Web services use standardized architectural patterns to enable communication between different applications.", "ground_truth": "An API that follows REpresentational State Transfer principles", "response": "**Representational State Transfer API** - an architectural style for web services that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs."}
{"query": "What is the purpose of unit testing?", "context": "Software quality assurance requires testing at multiple levels to catch bugs early in development.", "ground_truth": "Testing individual components or functions in isolation", "response": "To test individual components or functions of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly, catch bugs early, and make refactoring safer."}
{"query": "What is agile methodology?", "context": "Software development methodologies provide frameworks for organizing work and delivering value iteratively.", "ground_truth": "An iterative approach to software development emphasizing flexibility and collaboration", "response": "An iterative approach to software development emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and delivering working software in short cycles (sprints)."}
{"query": "What is a database index?", "context": "Database performance optimization involves structures that speed up data retrieval operations.", "ground_truth": "A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval", "response": "A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations by creating a sorted reference to table data, similar to a book's index."}
{"query": "What is Docker?", "context": "Containerization technologies help developers package applications with their dependencies for consistent deployment.", "ground_truth": "A platform for developing and running applications in containers", "response": "A platform for containerization that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments."}
{"query": "What is the Big O notation used for?", "context": "Algorithm efficiency analysis helps developers understand performance characteristics of their code.", "ground_truth": "Describing the time or space complexity of algorithms", "response": "To describe the time or space complexity of algorithms - how their performance scales as input size grows (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n²))."}
